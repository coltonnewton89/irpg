                <p>
                Wildland firefighters often respond to large scale
                disasters that can cover extensive geographic areas
                and impact many people. Often times these impacts
                are to large urban centers. Typical assignment tasks
                include search and rescue, debris clearing, and
                distribution of basic necessities. When responding,
                consider that basic services, utilities, transportation,
                medical care, credit card/ATM capability and law
                enforcement and security will likely be disrupted. Be
                considerate of those impacted by the disaster.

                • Plan to be self-sufficient for 24 to 48 hours. <br/>
                • Bring a GPS unit if possible. <br/>
                • Be prepared for extreme weather conditions
                associated with storm disasters. <br/>
                • Establish central rally points for assigned
                responders. <br/>
                • Develop local contacts for information gathering. <br/>
                • Dust and debris may interfere with respiration and visibility. <br/>
                • Weakened structures, fires, leaking hazardous
                materials, raw sewage contamination, and
                waterborne diseases may pose additional risks. <br/>
                • Mobility and access may be impaired by critical
                infrastructure damage, disrupted utilities,
                structural collapse, flooding, ice covered roads,
                or other barriers. <br/>
                • In the case of natural disasters, be aware of the
                additional threats following the initial storm or
                earthquake.
