                what transpired, in sufficient detail and clarity, so
                everyone understands what did and did not occur and
                why.</p>

                <p>Most importantly, participants should leave with a strong desire to improve their proficiency.</p>

                    <li>Reinforce that respectful disagreement is okay. Keep focused on the what, not the who.</li>
