                <h2><b>Incident Response Pocket Guide</b></h2>
                <p>The Incident Response Pocket Guide (IRPG) establishes
                    standards for wildland fire incident response. The guide
                    provides critical information on operational engagement, risk
                    management, all hazard response, and aviation management.
                    It provides a collection of best practices that have evolved
                    over time within the wildland fire service.</p>
                    <p>The IRPG does not provide absolute solutions to the
                        unlimited number of situations that will occur. Some fireline
                        decisions may be relatively simple; many are not. These
                        decisions often require individual judgment and creativity â€” skills developed through extensive training, dedicated
                        practice, and experience</p>
                        <br/><p>**************</p>
                        <p>The National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) provides
                            national leadership to enable interoperable wildland fire operations
                            among federal, state, tribal, territorial, and local partners. NWCG
                            operations standards are interagency by design; they are developed
                            with the intent of universal adoption by the member agencies.
                            However, the decision to adopt and utilize them is made
                            independently by the individual member agencies and communicated
                            through their respective directives systems.</p>
