                <h2><b>Wildland Urban Interface Firefighting</b></h2>
                <p>Structure protection is inherently dangerous because it
                involves indirect firefighting.</p>
                <p><b>Do not</b> commit to stay and protect a structure unless a
                safety zone for firefighters and equipment has been
                identified at the structure during sizeup and triage.
                Move to the nearest safety zone, let the fire front pass,
                and return as soon as conditions allow.</p>

                <b><u>Fire Behavior Prediction</u></b>
                • Base all actions on current and expected fire
                behavior – do this first! <br/>
                • An estimate must be made of the approaching fire
                intensity in order to determine if there is an
                adequate safety zone and time available before
                the fire arrives. <br/>
                • Due to the dynamic nature of fire behavior,
                intensity estimates are difficult to make with
                absolute certainty. It is imperative that
                firefighters consider the worst case and build
                contingency actions into their plan to compensate
                for the unexpected.

                <b><u>Structure Sizeup</u></b>
                <b>Site Considerations</b>
                • Adequate safety zone based on fire behavior prediction. <br/>
                • Adequate lookout and communication capability. <br/>
                • Adequate defensible space based on surrounding
                wildland vegetation. <br/>
                • Avoid narrow canyon bottoms, mid-slope with fire
                below, and narrow ridges near chimneys and saddles.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Tactical Challenges and Hazards</b>
                <p><i>(Firefighters with a safety zone can safely defend
                structures with some challenges.)</i></p>
                • Narrow roads, unknown bridge limits, and septic tank
                locations. <br/>
                • Ornamental plants and combustible debris within 30
                feet of structure. <br/>
                • Wooden siding and/or wooden roof materials. <br/>
                • Open vents, eaves, decks, and other ember traps. <br/>
                • Fuel tanks and hazardous materials. <br/>
                • Powerlines or underground utilities. <br/>
                • Limited water sources. <br/>
                • Prevailing sense of urgency. <br/>
                • Property owners remaining on-site or evacuations,
                which may cause panic. <br/>
                • Smoke byproducts often laced with chemical
                compounds not found in pure wildland fires.

                <b><u>Structure Triage</u></b>
                <b>Defensible – Prep and Hold</b>
                • Determining Factor: Safety zone present. <br/>
                • Sizeup: Structure has some tactical challenges. <br/>
                • Tactics: Firefighters needed on-site to implement
                structure protection tactics during fire front
                contact.
                <br/>
                <b>Defensible – Standalone</b>
                • Determining Factor: Safety zone present. <br/>
                • Sizeup: Structure has very few tactical
                challenges. <br/>
                • Tactics: Firefighters may not need to be directly
                assigned to protect structure as it is not likely to
                ignite during initial fire front contact. However,
                no structure in the path of a wildfire is
                completely without need of protection. Patrol
                following the passage of the fire front will be
                needed to protect the structure.
                <br/>
                <b>Non-Defensible – Prep and Leave</b>
                • Determining Factor: NO safety zone present. <br/>
                • Sizeup: Structure has some tactical challenges. <br/>
                • Tactics: Firefighters not able to commit to stay
                and protect structure. If time allows, rapid
                mitigation measures may be performed. Set
                trigger point for safe retreat. Remember preincident preparation is the responsibility of the
                homeowner. Patrol following the passage of the
                fire front will be needed to protect the structure.
                <br/>
                <b>Non-Defensible – Rescue Drive-By</b>
                • Determining Factor: NO safety zone present. <br/>
                • Sizeup: Structure has significant tactical
                challenges. <br/>
                • Tactics: Firefighters not able to commit to stay
                and protect structure. If time allows, check to
                ensure that people are not present in the
                threatened structure (especially children, elderly,
                and invalid). Set trigger point for safe retreat.
                Patrol following the passage of the fire front will
                be needed to protect the structure.

                <br/>
                <b><u>Structure Protection Tactics</u></b>
                <b>Rapid mitigation measures</b>
                • Remove small combustibles immediately next to
                structure. <br/>
                • Close windows and doors, including garage (leave
                unlocked). <br/>
                • Clean area around fuel tank and shut off tank. <br/>
                • Charge garden hoses. <br/>
                • Apply CAF, foam, or gel retardants if available.
                <b>Equipment and water use</b>
                • Mark entrance to indicate a staffed location if it is not
                obvious. <br/>
                • Charge hose lines. <br/>
                • Long hose lays are not recommended. <br/>
                • Keep 100 gallons of water in reserve. <br/>
                • Identify a backup water source. <br/>
                • Identify powerlines for aerial resources. <br/>
                • Never rely on water for firefighter safety. <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Patrol following the fire front</b>
                • Many structures do not burn until after the fire front has
                passed. <br/>
                • Be aware of the structural collapse zone when
                structures are exposed to fire. <br/>
                • Move to closest safety zone and let fire front go
                through. <br/>
                • Return as soon as conditions allow safe access to
                structures. <br/>
                • Secondary ignition is usually due to residual spot fires
                or creeping ground fire. <br/>
                • Take suppression actions within your capability. <br/>
                • Call for assistance if needed.
