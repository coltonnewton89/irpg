                <h2><b>Thunderstorm Safety</b></h2>
                <p>Approaching thunderstorms may be noted by a sudden
                reverse in wind direction, a noticeable rise in wind speed, and
                a sharp drop in temperature. Rain, hail, and lightning occur
                only in the mature stage of a thunderstorm.</p>
                <p><b>Situation Awareness: </b>Sound waves move at different rates
                based on atmospheric conditions. Take the storm precautions
                below as soon as you hear thunder, not when the storm is
                upon you. Do not resume work in exposed areas until 30
                minutes after storm activity has passed.</p>
                <b>Hazard Control:</b>
                <p>
                • Take shelter in a vehicle or building if possible. <br/>
                • If outdoors, find a low spot away from tall trees, wire
                fences, utility lines and other elevated conductive
                objects. Make sure the place you pick is not subject to
                flooding. <br/>
                • If in the woods, move to an area with shorter trees.
                • If only isolated trees are nearby, keep your distance
                twice the tree height. <br/>
                • If in open country, crouch low, with feet together,
                minimizing contact with the ground. You can use a
                pack to sit on, but never lie on the ground. <br/>
                • If you feel your skin tingle or your hair stand on end,
                immediately crouch low to the ground. Make yourself
                the smallest possible target and minimize your contact
                with the ground. <br/>
                • Don’t group together. <br/>
                • Don’t stay on ridge tops, in wide open areas, or near
                ledges or rock outcroppings. <br/>
                • Don’t operate landline telephones, machinery, or
                electric motors. <br/>
                • Don’t handle metal hand tools or flammable materials
                in open containers.
