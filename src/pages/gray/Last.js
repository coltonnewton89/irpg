                <h2><b>Last Resort Survival</b></h2>
                <b>Escape if you can.</b> <br/>
                • Utilize all your PPE and act immediately on your
                best option. <br/>
                • Drop your gear to increase escape speed. Keep
                your fire shelter and, if time allows, your hand
                tool, water, and radio. <br/>
                • You may be able to use the fire shelter for a heat
                shield as you move. <br/>
                • In LIGHT FUELS, you may be able to move
                through the flames into the black. <br/>
                • If you are on the flank of the fire, try to get below
                the fire. <br/>
                • Consider vehicles or helicopters for escape.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Find a survivable area.</b> <br/>
                Stay out of hazardous terrain features.
                • Use bodies of water. <br/>
                • In LIGHT FUELS, you may be able to light an
                escape fire. In other fuels, you may be able to
                light a backfire. <br/>
                • Call for helicopter or retardant drops. <br/>
                • Cut and scatter fuels if there is time. <br/>
                • Use any available heat barriers such as large
                rocks and dozer berms. <br/>
                • Consider vehicle traffic hazards on roads. <br/>
                • Structures and vehicles may be an option for
                temporary refuge. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Pick a fire shelter deployment site.</b> <br/>
                • Your first priority is to maximize distance from
                nearest surface fuels. <br/>
                • Find the lowest point available. <br/>
                • If possible, pick a surface that allows the fire
                shelter to seal and remove ground fuels. <br/>
                • Get into the fire shelter before the flame front
                hits. <br/>
                • Position your feet toward the fire and hold down
                the fire shelter. <br/>
                • Keep your face pressed into the ground and
                protect your airway. <br/>
                • Deploy next to each other and keep talking.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Expect:</b> <br/>
                • Extremely heavy ember showers. <br/>
                • Superheated air blast to hit before the flame front. <br/>
                • Noise and turbulent powerful winds hitting the
                fire shelter. <br/>
                • Heat and fire glow inside the fire shelter. <br/>
                • Long deployment times…WHEN IN DOUBT
                WAIT IT OUT. <br/>
                • Do not expect radio communication capabilities. <br/>
                • Do not expect water or retardant from aerial
                resources.
