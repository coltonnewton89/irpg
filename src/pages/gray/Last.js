                • Utilize all your PPE and act immediately on your
                best option. <br/>
                • Drop your gear to increase escape speed. Keep
                your fire shelter and, if time allows, your hand
                tool, water, and radio. <br/>
                • You may be able to use the fire shelter for a heat
                shield as you move. <br/>
                • In LIGHT FUELS, you may be able to move
                through the flames into the black. <br/>
                • If you are on the flank of the fire, try to get below
                the fire. <br/>
                • Consider vehicles or helicopters for escape.

                <b>Find a survivable area.</b> <br/>
                Stay out of hazardous terrain features.
                • Use bodies of water. <br/>
                • In LIGHT FUELS, you may be able to light an
                escape fire. In other fuels, you may be able to
                light a backfire. <br/>
                • Call for helicopter or retardant drops. <br/>
                • Cut and scatter fuels if there is time. <br/>
                • Use any available heat barriers such as large
                rocks and dozer berms. <br/>
                • Consider vehicle traffic hazards on roads. <br/>
                • Structures and vehicles may be an option for
                temporary refuge.
