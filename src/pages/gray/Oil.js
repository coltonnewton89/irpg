                <h2><b>Oil and Gas Site Safety</b></h2>
                <p>When responding to an incident with oil and gas fields
                and/or coal seams, you must receive the appropriate
                training or a briefing before your operational
                assignment. Primary hazards include toxic gases as
                well as industry operations and facilities.</p>
                <b>Situation Awareness</b>
                <p>
                Methane (CH4): <br/>
                • Toxic, flammable, odorless, and colorless. <br/>
                • Unlikely to cause physical problems in open
                environment, but does pose a fire risk in high
                concentrations. <br/>
                • Beware of enclosed buildings/vehicles if gas is
                suspected. <br/>
                <br/>
                Hydrogen Sulfide Gas (H2S) <br/>
                • Highly toxic, flammable, and colorless gas. <br/>
                • Odor of rotten eggs at low concentrations. <br/>
                • Sense of smell rapidly deteriorates at higher
                concentrations. <br/>
                • Exposure indicators include high heart rate,
                respiratory paralysis, seizures, and rapid
                incapacitation.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <b>Hazard Control</b>
                <br/>
                • Ensure contact is made with the appropriate
                authorities before engaging in suppression
                activities. <br/>
                • Ask for H2S monitor/breathing apparatus and
                adequate briefing. <br/>
                • Do not depend of sense of smell for warning. <br/>
                • Avoid low lying areas during stagnant air
                conditions. <br/>
                • Anticipate industry traffic on narrow,
                unimproved roads. <br/>
                • Be aware of exposed pipes and utility lines. <br/>
                • Park at least 20 feet away from facilities and
                equipment. Avoid tampering with the oil and gas
                pumping equipment. <br/>
                • Avoid open pits/dumps. <br/>
                • Before starting dozer operations, ask your local
                dispatch to notify the appropriate utility
                representative. Don’t assume pipelines are buried
                deeply or directly under their markers. <br/>
                <b>• Seek immediate medical care at a hospital if H2S exposure is suspected.</b>
